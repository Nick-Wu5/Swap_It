## Detailed Description of Classes

### UserProfile
**Functionality:** This class stores data for each user account, including the username, password, email, list of friends, and list of blocked friends. In addition, the class includes methods for getting and setting all fields, as well as functionality to add and remove friends and block users. Finally, this class contains the methods toFileFormat() and saveToFile(), which convert user data to a string and save it to users.txt for later access. This class serves as the foundation for individual account creation and data.

**Testing:** This functionality of this class is evaluated by the UserProfileTest test case file. The setUp() method initializes three UserProfile instances (user1, user2, user3) before each test to ensure a consistent environment for testing. The methods testAddFriend(), testRemoveFriend, and testBlockUser() are tested with assertTrue and assertFalse to ensure their functionality behaves as expected. Next, the toFileFormat() method is validated for correct string output. Finally, the findUserByUsername() is tested for both existing and non-existing users to ensure correct behavior when reading from a file.

### UserSearch
**Functionality:** This class provides methods for user search functionality. Specifically, it reads all usernames stored in users.txt and compares them to the given username. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding user as an object otherwise, it returns null. To create a UserProfile object when a matching username is found, the class uses the getSearchedUser()method, which utilizes a no-argument constructor and creates the object with data from users.txt. This class directly interacts with the UserProfile class by reading and using data generated by that class.

**Testing:** The class is tested using the UserSearchTest file. First, the setUp() method creates a users.txt file with mock data. Three test cases were written to ensure the findUserByUsername() method behaves as expected: when the user exists, does not exist, and when the user has friends/blocked users. Finally, the getSearchedUser() method is tested to make sure it processes the user data in the right order to successfully create a UserProfile object. 

### PasswordProtectedLogin
**Functionality:** This class loads the users and checks if the username and password are valid. The loadUsersFromFile method reads user information from a file and loads it into two lists: users (for usernames) and passes (for passwords). The login method prompts the person to enter a username and password which is then authenticated by the authenticate method. If the login information is valid then the authenticate method returns true. If the login information is incorrect then the authenticate method returns false and prompts the person to try again.

**Testing:** This class is tested using the PasswordProtectedLoginTest file. The testLoadUsersFromFile method checks if the class correctly loads users from the users.txt file. The testAuthenticateValidCredentials method and testAuthenticateInvalidCredentials methods check if the correct information validates and incorrect information invalidates.

### CreateNewUser
**Functionality:** This class extends the UserProfile class and creates a new user including a username, password, a boolean called alreadyRegistered that checks whether the inputted username already exists in the system, a list of user profiles, and other fields and methods inherited from its parent class.  In addition, CreateNewUser contains a field storing a the name of file which contains each user’s information and new users are saved to this file using the saveUserToFile() method and users can be loaded from the file to the list of user profiles using the loadUsersFromFile() method. Finally, this class contains the method checkIfUserExists() to check whether an inputted username is already associated with a user profile and then returns the boolean value to alreadyRegistered, as well as a main method which contains a Scanner object that asks the user to input an email address, password, and also checks to see if this email address is already existing.

**Testing:** This class is tested using the CreateNewUserTest file.  This class specifically creates a new user, no duplicate usernames, and persistence with save and load.  The test first  uses a method set up by clearing the list of user profiles and the file that stores them.  Then, creating new users is tested by creating a new user and failing the test if the username already exists as well as retrieving the profile of the newly created user and failing the test if the profile is null (suggesting no profile was made) or if the username doesn’t equal the name given when instantiating a user object.  Next, duplicate usernames are tested by instantiating two user objects of the same username and then failing the test if both still exist in the list of user profiles.  Finally, the persistence of saving and loading the file’s contents is tested by creating a new user, saving their information onto the user file, and then loading their info back onto the list of user profiles, where the test fails if the size of the user profiles list is only one and if the username of the one user profile is not matching the user object.

### NewsComment
**Functionality:** This class implements the NewsFeed interface and allows users to downvote,upvote, delete, and comment on posts. In the file output the content and author is logged along with the comment controls like upvote and downvote initialized to 0. This class took into account the readability where “----” was used to separate comments in the file and each comment is written line by line. The PrintWriter is used with the FileWriter to write to newComments.txt. This was written so when the machine is shut down the file that stores all the comments will be able to be read when the machine is started back up, taking that into account the IOException was implemented to address any errors during file writing. Both upvotes and downvotes are incremented to go up by one, and then the class uses the getUpvote() method to return the difference of upvotes and downvotes. 

**Testing:** This class is tested using the NewsCommentTest file. This test case implements UserProfile instances that can stand in place of actual users. This will simulate a conversation in the comments and the way that they interact with the other users comments such as downvoting or upvoting the comment. The testing process is first initializing a comment with the content and author and then it is retrieved and prints the details such as the username, content, and the comment upvotes. Then the test has the upvote and downvote test that will increment to two upvotes and then one downvote which is then printed out and returns the calculated upvote count.  

### NewsPost
**Functionality:** This class implements the NewsFeed interface that displays a brief headline for the post, the username, date posted, and a counter to upvote and downvote the post. And for the post there is an imagePath which is the file path associated with the image in a post. The ArrayList<NewsComment> comment holds the comments for the users post, each comment is an instance which is found in the class NewsComment which includes information about the user and each comment. The comments are initialized in the constructor as empty so that it could store other users comments, along with the upvotes and downvotes initialized to 0. And after all the attributes are initialized it is written to the file using the printWriter object to the newPosts.txt file. 

**Testing:** This class is tested using the NewsPostTest file, UserProfile instances are implemented to simulate a user posting to the newsfeed and then it is tested to see if the values of title, date, and imagePath are returned and match the expected values if even one of them fails to return the test fails. The post upvotes and downvotes are also incremented to test if the getUpvotes() will return the correct calculated upvotes to the post. Checks if the getComments() will return the correct number of comments entered along with the addComment() if any comments could be added to the post, test fails if any of the comment details are not returned.
